# Finetuning-LLM-for-Medical-conversation
This project focuses on fine-tuning Large Language Model (Llama-2-7B) for medical conversations. It involves preprocessing raw medical conversation data, training language models using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, and fine-tuning pre-trained models on medical conversation datasets for domain-specific tasks.
# Features
## Data Preprocessing: 
Transforming raw medical conversation data.
## Model Training: 
Training language models.
## Fine-tuning: 
Fine-tuning the pre-trained LLAMA-2-7B model on medical conversation datasets.
